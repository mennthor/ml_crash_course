# ML crash Course

Crash course for selected machine learning topics including a brief introduction of the necessary math and statistics.

Everything in this repository is collected from some book, website or course material I had left from my university time from many excellent resources to that have been already written over and over for this topic.
So I explicitly do not want to claim any presented knowledge for myself.
I also do not explicitly note every source I got the input from, because I think everything is generic enough.
Use sources like https://hackernoon.com/16-best-resources-to-learn-ai-machine-learning-in-2019-f95c4f59018b and you'll get a list of extremely helpful sites and resources from which I probably took information.

## Structure

Everything that is used for building the slides is stored in the build folder and generated via `make.

- `tex` contains the latex documents for generating the slides.
- `sample_solutions` contain Jupyter Notebooks with sample solutions for the corresponding exercises in the slides.
- `assets` contains resources used to build the slides, eg. image generating scripts.
